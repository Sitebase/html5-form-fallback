=== FEATURES ===
- Add placeholder for older browsers
- Add autofocus for older browsers
- Add form validation (email, url, number)

=== HOW TO USE ===
1. You can style the placeholder in your CSS by styling the class .placeholder
2. Add invalid class to your CSS
        .invalid{
                // style here
        }
        Don't add it to the same selector as :invalid because it will not work
        in IE this way:
        input:invalid, .invalid{
                // style here
        }
3. Include this script just before the closing body tag.
